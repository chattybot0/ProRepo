# ProRepo
The amazing repo format.<br>
**ProRepo** is a perfect choice for you if you want to create a repository.<br>
ProRepo contains a built-in API endpoint which you can connect and get details of a repository.<br>
ProRepo is currently under active developement and will have frequent updates.<br>
We are planning for an **npm***, **javascript** and **packagist** package which gives the users full access to ProRepo on **node.js**,**javascript** and **PHP**.
